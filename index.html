      <h3>Sampling images with algorithms - by Zack Leinwand</h3>

      <p>
        Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize an algorithm, we donâ€™t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset.
        Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual,
        as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them.
        But algorithms are also a reminder that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data.
        Visualization leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to better understand these
        important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too. <br/><br/><p class='sig'>-Matt Bostock, creator of D3</p>

      <h3>The algorithms and why we use them</h3>
      <div class="algoExplainer">
        <p class='algoText'>
          From post production effects to anti-aliasing techniques to computer vision, random sampling algorithms are being used everyday under the hood of many technologies we take for granted. After doing research on random sampling algorithms, I found the three best examples to illustrate are Uniform Random, Mitchell's Best Candidate,
          and Bridson's Implementation of Poisson Disc. They all use randomness to pick sample points, with varying levels of restrictions. Uniform Random
          has no restrictions, Best Candidate has some, and Poisson Disc has an absolute restriction on minimum distance between points. We will be using
          these algorithms to find random sample points on Van Gogh masterpieces to build Voronoi diagrams from the colors of those points. This will
          illustrate how uniform (or not) these random sample algorithms are. I implemented the algorithms to run and display their points in a 'real time'
          visualization of themselves at work. We can watch them build their interpretation of Van Gogh's work as a Voronoi Diagram

          A voronoi diagram takes a series of points and creates polygons mapped by regions closest to each point.
          Each pixel within a polygon is closer to it's polygon's sample point than any other. We use the sample
          point's position within the painting to determine its color, and pass down that color to every pixel within
          the Voronoi polygon. The result is a beautiful algorithmic interpretation of the colors and positions of
          the colors of the painting while only needing a small portion of the data of the original image
