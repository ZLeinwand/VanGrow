### MVP
An algorithm visualization tool that takes sampling algorithms and uses them over paintings to create voronoi diagrams using the most common color to each point. Will feature 3 algorithms (Uniform Random, Mitchell's Best Candidate, Poisson-disc), how they work, and then live animation of them in action over a painting, while building a voronoi diagram of the most common color around each sample point.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
Will use JS with D3, HTML, and CSS

### Timeline

1) implement algorithms in JS .8 Days

2) Build skeleton of webapp in HTML CSS .2 Days

3) learn D3 1 Day

4) integrate D3/Algos/HTML/CSS 2 Days

5) Debug/Polish 1 Day

6) Profit
