### About
An algorithm visualization tool that takes sampling algorithms and uses them over paintings to create voronoi diagrams using the most common color to each point. Features 3 algorithms (Uniform Random, Mitchell's Best Candidate, Poisson-disk), how they work, and a live animation of them in action over a painting, while building a voronoi diagram of the most common color around each sample point.

### Why
I wanted to do something extremely challenging for myself involving algorithms. I had never read or even looked at a whitepaper before. This pushed me far outside my comfort zone and was definitely a struggle to make sense of the abstract at first. I'm glad I stuck with it and gained valuable experience in algorithm implementation. The final product is simple, elegant, and beautiful. As a good algorithm should be.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
Uses JS with D3, HTML, and CSS
